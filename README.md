# PerfBugReplication
Artifacts of an experiment on reproducing performance bugs from bug reports
The artifacts spreadsheet has a few tabs. 
The "Reproducible" tab contains statistics on the characteristics of the reproducible bus.
The "Non-Reproducible" tab contains bugs that we have tried but failed to reproduce.
The "Suggestions" tab contains some tips and solutions on how to handle a specific type of non-reproducible bug.
